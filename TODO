Q: Maybe we could do away with only BOTTOM and RIGHT walls (if boundaries are already handled as walls), but it's not that important

Bugs:
- If started in landscape mode, the acceleration vector is not (always) corrected for rotation
- Ball isRolling and target coordinates are not reset when changing levels -> can be fatal
