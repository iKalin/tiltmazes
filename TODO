V0.1 - Developer-forum release

V1.0 - First Android Market release

TODO:
P1 - Refactor: move game logic out of TiltMazesMainView into a separate class (it's very messy currently)
P1 - Add "About" menu item with copyright info and rules
P1 - Add "solved" detection (actually: add full game state machine)
P1 - Implement life-cycle management properly (start, stop, pause, resume, save, restore, destroy)
P1 - Add all level designs from http://clickmazes.com/newtilt/ixtilt2d.htm
P1 - Display number of remaining goals
P1 - Display number of steps taken
P1 - Create separate layout for landscape mode

P2 - Enable/disable accelerometer ("Tilt sensor" or simply "Tilt")
P2 - Add "high-scores" functionality (score = number of steps? time? or 1/(time * steps)?)

P3 - Add maze selection from a proper List view
P3 - Add proper logging
P3 - Name unnamed numeric constants

P4 - Add icon for every level design

Q: Maybe we could do away with only BOTTOM and RIGHT walls (if boundaries are already handled as walls), but it's not that important

Bugs:
- If started in landscape mode, the acceleration vector is not (always) corrected for rotation
- Ball isRolling and target coordinates are not reset when changing levels -> can be fatal
