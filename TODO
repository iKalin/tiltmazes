- Add UI functionality
	- Add menu / buttons
		- Level selection from a proper List view
		- Enable/disable accelerometer ("Tilt sensor" or simply "Tilt")
	- Add "high-scores" functionality (score = number of steps? time? or 1/(time * steps)?)
- Make the UI nicer
	- Display level name
	- Display remaining goals
	- Display number of steps taken
	- Replace filled circle with proper bitmap
	- Replace walls with bitmaps
	- Replace background with bitmaps
- Add proper logging
- Refactor: move game logic out of TiltMazesMainView into a separate class
- Maybe we could do away with only BOTTOM and RIGHT walls (if boundaries are already handled as walls), but it's not that important

Bugs:
- If started in landscape mode, the acceleration vector is not (always) corrected for rotation
- Ball isRolling and target coordinates are not reset when changing levels -> can be fatal
