V1.0 - First Android Market release

TODO:
P1 - Save accelerometer enabled/disabled status as a preference
P1 - Implement "Congratulations!" dialog when user solves a maze
P1 - Create separate layout for landscape mode

P2 - Display About Dialog on first start

P3 - Name unnamed numeric constants
P3 - Move strings into resources

Bugs:
- If started in landscape mode, the acceleration vector is not (always) corrected for rotation
- Ball isRolling and target coordinates are not reset when changing levels -> can be fatal


V1.1 - Bugfix + speedup release
P1 - Fix reported bugs
P1 - Speed up the code according to suggestions at http://code.google.com/android/toolbox/performance.html
P1 - Major speed-up: separate Wall drawing from Ball drawing using FrameLayout

P2 - Add "high-scores" functionality (score = number of steps? time? or 1/(time * steps)?)

P3 - Add proper logging

P4 - Add icon for every level design
P4 - Correct indentation in .java files
P4 - Add screenshots to code.google.com/p/tiltmazes project page
