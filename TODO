V1.0 - First Android Market release

TODO:
P1 - Add the following functionality to GameEngine:
		Save accelerometer enabled/disabled status as a preference
		Handle SOLVED event
P1 - Add "solved" detection
P1 - Display number of steps taken
		- save solved state for mazes + number of steps taken
P1 - Create separate layout for landscape mode
P1 - Replace auto-increment id column on the mazes table with one-to-one array index mapping

P2 - Display About Dialog on first start
P2 - Add "high-scores" functionality (score = number of steps? time? or 1/(time * steps)?)

P3 - Add proper logging
P3 - Name unnamed numeric constants
P3 - Separate Wall drawing from Ball drawing using FrameLayout

P4 - Add icon for every level design
P4 - Correct indentation in .java files

P5 - Maybe we could do away with only BOTTOM and RIGHT walls (if boundaries are already handled as walls), but it's not that important

Bugs:
- If started in landscape mode, the acceleration vector is not (always) corrected for rotation
- Ball isRolling and target coordinates are not reset when changing levels -> can be fatal
