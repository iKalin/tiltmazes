TiltMazes

A logical puzzle game for the Android platform, based on the tilt-maze collection of Andrea Gilbert
http://www.clickmazes.com/

A ball sits in a flat tray containing one or more squares (goals).
The challenge is to guide the ball around the tray and collect all the squares.
Tilt the tray to, literally, start the ball rolling.
The ball rolls in a straight line until it hits a wall, you can then tilt again.
