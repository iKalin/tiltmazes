V0.1 - Developer-forum release

V1.0 - First Android Market release

TODO:
- Implement onMeasure()?
- Add "solved" detection
- Add Copyright info to XML files
- Create dynamic layout with menus / buttons
- Replace MapDesigns with a saner construct (the current version _hurts_ to look at)
- Move colors into resources
- Name unnamed numeric constants
- Implement state save / restore
- Add all level designs from http://clickmazes.com/newtilt/ixtilt2d.htm
- Add icon for every level design
- Add UI functionality
	- Add menu / buttons
		- Level selection
		- Enable/disable accelerometer ("Tilt sensor" or simply "Tilt")
	- Add "high-scores" functionality (score = number of steps)
- Make the UI nicer
	- Replace filled circle with proper bitmap
	- Replace walls with bitmaps
	- Replace background with bitmaps
- Add proper logging
- Refactor: move game logic out of TiltMazesMainView into a separate class
- Maybe we could do away with only BOTTOM and RIGHT walls (if boundaries are already handled as walls), but it's not that important

Bugs:
- If started in landscape mode, the acceleration vector is not (always) corrected for rotation
